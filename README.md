# Maps & Addresses API
This is an app that enables you to get addresses of clicked places and saves
them to an Sqlite database and Google Fusion Table.

## Tutorial
### Prerequisites
This is app runs on Python 3.6+ and Django 1.9.

### Installation
Clone or download this repository, create and activate a virtual environment and install required packages
 in your virtual environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. If you are new to Django, you can learn
 more on Python and Django installation from the [Django Girls Tutorial.](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/)
Create API keys for [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and
[Google Fusion Tables](https://developers.google.com/fusiontables/docs/v1/using#APIKey) and update
`YOUR_KEY` values in `templates/addresses/index.html` file.

If you do not have a separate developer account with [Google](https://mail.google.com), it maybe necessary that
you sign up for one that you will use to work with Google Fusion Tables so that you do not risk losing your data.
